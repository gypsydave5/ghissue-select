# coauthor-select

## Usage

1. Run `make setup`
2. Update authors.json to contain the names and email addresses of the people you commonly work with
3. Create a `pair.json` file in the repo root with the names of the people you want to pair with. e.g `["Tamara"]`. This defines the people in your current pairing session
4. Commit. You'll be able to see the co-authors in the commit message
